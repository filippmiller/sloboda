# SLOBODA - Project Summary

## What Is SLOBODA?

SLOBODA is a rural infrastructure platform that positions itself as **"Plan B that exists"** - a real, tangible backup plan for urban knowledge workers who see AI-driven economic disruption on the horizon.

The name "Sloboda" comes from a historical Russian term for a free settlement - a place exempt from feudal obligations, where people settled on their own terms. The project carries that spirit: build your own future, together with others.

---

## Philosophy & Driving Force

The project rests on a single bold thesis:

> AI will replace knowledge workers. Cities exist because of jobs. Remove the jobs - and cities become traps. People will need somewhere to go.

This is not a utopian dream or an investment pitch. SLOBODA deliberately positions itself as **anti-hype**:

- No promises of riches
- No guaranteed returns
- No selling of dreams
- Only honest preparation for a future that is already arriving

The philosophy is built on six pillars:

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Democracy** | One person, one vote. Decisions made together. |
| **Respect** | People are not resources. Everyone matters. |
| **Transparency** | All finances and decisions visible to everyone. |
| **Realism** | No promises. Only facts and honest conversation. |
| **Common Cause** | Build together, own together. |
| **Freedom** | Participate with money, time, or knowledge - your choice. |

The core belief that holds everything together:

> "What is impossible alone - is possible together."

## The Clientele

### Who This Is For

**Primary audience**: Urban knowledge workers aged 25-55, primarily Russian-speaking, currently living in cities. Programmers, analysts, accountants, lawyers, managers - the exact professions most exposed to AI replacement.

**What they have in common**:
- They see AI disruption coming and take it seriously
- They think one step ahead, not one step behind
- They have some savings ($10K-$100K range)
- They want something real - land, a house, a community - not another digital promise
- They may have families and want long-term security

**Secondary audience**: Russian diaspora abroad, people from former Soviet states who want a "home base" option.

### What They Feel

- Fear of losing their livelihood to AI (high)
- Fear of being trapped in an expensive city without income (high)
- Frustration at not being able to solve this alone (high)
- Desire for tangible, physical security (high)
- Distrust of traditional financial investments (medium)

SLOBODA speaks directly to these fears - not to exploit them, but to offer a structured, collective response.

## The Front Page

The landing page is a long, narrative-driven scroll that walks a visitor through the entire story - from the problem, to the vision, to the economics, to action. Here is what it contains:

### 1. Hero Section
A full-screen documentary-style rural landscape. Rotating slogans fade in and out. Two call-to-action buttons: **"Join the community"** and **"Become a co-investor"**. A social proof counter appears once 10+ people have registered.

### 2. Three Truths (The Thesis)
Three cards that lay out the argument:
- **AI changes everything** - professions are being replaced
- **Cities will become expensive** - without jobs, mortgages fail, property drops
- **Return to the land** - people will seek affordable community living

### 3. The Founder
A section introducing Philip Miller with a photo and rotating personal quotes about community, values, and why this project exists.

### 4. Values
Six core values displayed as cards: Democracy, Respect, Transparency, Realism, Common Cause, Freedom.

### 5. Who We're Looking For
Six roles the project actively seeks: Farmers, Builders, Lawyers, Scouts, Co-investors, Storytellers. This signals that money is not the only way in - skills and time count too.

### 6. Village Vision
An interactive SVG diagram showing what a SLOBODA settlement looks like: a central farm surrounded by houses, community buildings, workshops, and green zones - all connected by radial paths. Three feature cards explain the central farm, personal plots (1000-1500 m2), and shared spaces (workshop, club, coworking).

### 7. Economics (The Numbers)
A side-by-side comparison:

| | Moscow (city) | SLOBODA (village) |
|---|---|---|
| Housing | 80,000 rub/mo | 0 (own property) |
| Food | 40,000 | 15,000 |
| Transport | 15,000 | 5,000 |
| Utilities | 12,000 | 6,000 |
| Other | 20,000 | 5,000 (cooperative fee) |
| **Total** | **167,000 rub/mo** | **31,000 rub/mo** |

**Savings: 136,000 rub per month (1.6 million rub per year)**

### 8. Participation Tiers
Four levels of involvement:

| Tier | Cost | What You Get |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Observer** | Free | Community access, news, discussions |
| **Pioneer** | $10,000 | Plot reservation, voting rights, farm share |
| **Builder** | $30,000 | Plot + house share, farm share, priority selection |
| **Founder** | $50,000+ | Plot + full house, rental income, infrastructure share |

### 9. Investment Calculator
An interactive slider ($0-$100K) that dynamically shows what your investment gets you: tier, plot size, housing type, estimated rental and farm income.

### 10. Roadmap
Five phases showing where the project is now:
1. **Community** (current phase) - building the team
2. **Land** - search, evaluation, purchase
3. **Infrastructure** - roads, power, water, internet
4. **Construction** - houses, farm, community buildings
5. **Living** - operating village, working farm, community life

### 11. Legal Structure
Explains the cooperative model (Agricultural Consumer Cooperative / SPоK):
- Each participant is a co-owner
- One person = one vote
- Income distributed proportionally, 20% goes to development fund
- Exit anytime - share bought back at market value, house is yours to keep or sell

### 12. FAQ
Six common questions answered honestly, including the one about risk: "This is not a classic investment with guaranteed returns. We are creating a real asset. Risks exist. We are building a long-term alternative."

### 13. Registration Form
A 6-step form that collects: basic info, motivation, participation intent, skills, investor details (conditional), and final consent. The form is designed to qualify leads while also understanding what each person can contribute beyond money.

### 14. Footer
Brand line: "SLOBODA - Plan B that exists in reality." Links to Telegram, updates page, and contact email.

## Design & Tone

The visual language is **organic and documentary** - earthy colors (dark greens, warm browns), elegant serif typography (Cormorant Garamond) for headlines, clean sans-serif (Onest) for body text, and a subtle glassmorphism effect on cards. The imagery feels real, not polished - like a documentary, not an advertisement.

The writing tone is **calm, direct, and honest**. No exclamation marks. No hype. No "limited time offer." The language of someone who has thought deeply about a problem and is quietly building a solution.

---

## Current Status

The project is in **Phase 1: Community Building**. The landing page is live, collecting registrations, and building a base of interested participants. The founder is assembling the initial team of investors, specialists, and future residents before moving to land acquisition.
