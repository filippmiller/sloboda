# SLOBODA - Project Summary

## What Is SLOBODA?

SLOBODA is a decentralized network of autonomous eco-settlements positioned as **"Plan B that exists"** - a real, tangible backup plan for urban knowledge workers who see AI-driven economic disruption on the horizon.

The name "Sloboda" comes from a historical Russian term for a free settlement - a place exempt from feudal obligations, where people settled on their own terms. The project carries that spirit: build your own future, together with others.

---

## Philosophy & Driving Force

The project rests on a single bold thesis:

> AI will replace knowledge workers. Cities exist because of jobs. Remove the jobs - and cities become traps. People will need somewhere to go.

This is not a utopian dream or an investment pitch. SLOBODA deliberately positions itself as **radically honest**:

- No fake statistics or inflated numbers
- No promises of guaranteed returns
- Crossed-out fake metrics to demonstrate transparency
- Only honest preparation for a future that is already arriving

The philosophy is built on six pillars:

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Democracy** | One person, one vote. Decisions made together. |
| **Respect** | People are not resources. Everyone matters. |
| **Transparency** | All finances and decisions visible to everyone. |
| **Realism** | No promises. Only facts and honest conversation. |
| **Common Cause** | Build together, own together. |
| **Freedom** | Participate with money, time, or knowledge - your choice. |

The core belief:

> "What is impossible alone - is possible together."

## The Clientele

### Who This Is For

**Primary audience**: Urban knowledge workers aged 25-55, primarily Russian-speaking. Programmers, analysts, accountants, lawyers, managers - the exact professions most exposed to AI replacement.

**Secondary audience**: Russian diaspora abroad who want a "home base" option.

### What They Feel

- Fear of losing their livelihood to AI (high)
- Fear of being trapped in an expensive city without income (high)
- Desire for tangible, physical security (high)
- Distrust of traditional financial investments (medium)

SLOBODA speaks directly to these fears - not to exploit them, but to offer a structured, collective response.

## Design & Tone

### Visual Language

The visual identity is **dark, bold, and urgent** - a stark contrast to typical eco-project aesthetics:

| Element | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Background** | Near-black (#0a0a0a) |
| **Accent color** | Bold red (#c23616) |
| **Display font** | Unbounded (geometric, modern) |
| **Body font** | Golos Text (clean, readable) |
| **Card style** | Semi-transparent dark panels with subtle borders |
| **Overall feel** | Tech-forward, urgent, documentary |

### Honesty Design Pattern

A distinctive design choice: **fake statistics are shown crossed out** with red strikethroughs, followed by honest callouts explaining the truth. This applies to:

- Social proof counter (fake "423 participants" - crossed out)
- Progress bars (fake "42% funded" - crossed out)
- Stats grid (fake specialist counts - crossed out)
- CTA heading (fake "Join 423 participants" - crossed out)

Each crossed-out element is accompanied by a truth callout box explaining that the project is just starting and these numbers would be lies.

### Writing Tone

**Urgent, direct, and viscerally honest.** The hero opens with "You feel it, don't you?" and describes the anxiety of layoff news and banking instability. No gentle easing in - the page hits hard and fast.

---

## The Front Page

The landing page is a long, narrative-driven scroll that walks visitors from fear to action.

### 1. Sticky Header

Navigation links: Why / How it works / About us / FAQ. CTA button "Join". Language switcher (Russian/English). Hamburger menu on mobile.

### 2. Bookmark Banner

A dismissible top banner asking visitors to bookmark the site: "This is probably the most important website you've visited."

### 3. Hero Section

Single-column layout, text above video:

- **Badge**: "Built with AI"
- **Headline**: "You feel it, don't you?"
- **Body**: Describes the anxiety of layoffs, banking instability, the quiet question "What if it all falls apart?"
- **Answer**: "You're not paranoid. You're perceptive."
- **CTAs**: "Secure your place" (primary) + "Watch overview (3 min)" (secondary, opens video modal)
- **Honesty callout**: Explains the project is just starting, no fake numbers
- **Crossed-out fake stats**: "423 participants", "847K raised", "23 cities" - all visually struck through
- **Video placeholder**: "What is SLOBODA in 60 seconds" (video not yet produced)

### 4. The Pivot (Fear to Hope)

"While others panic, we build." Three value propositions:
- When the system wobbles - we'll be ready
- When you need community - we'll be here
- When it's time to act - you won't be alone

### 5. AI Profession Checker

An interactive tool that uses Claude AI to analyze any profession's vulnerability to AI replacement:

- Text input field for profession name
- AI generates an aggressive, urgent analysis including:
  - Risk level (CRITICAL for computer-based work)
  - Timeline before replacement (1-2 years for programmers)
  - Already-happening signals
  - Specific recommendations
  - Conclusion urging immediate action
- Results displayed in a **modal window**
- Powered by Claude Haiku API on the backend

### 6. Reality Check

"Things still seem fine?" A section with three cards:
- **Honest question**: "If I work on a computer, can AI replace me?" (Answer: YES)
- **What happens next**: Mass layoffs, impossible competition for remaining jobs
- **What to do**: Don't wait. Build an alternative. Now.

### 7. Why Now (Timeline)

Visual timeline with four phases:
- **2024-2025**: Signs multiply (AI replacing workers, bank instability, city exodus)
- **2026**: "YOU ARE HERE" - window of opportunity still open
- **2027-2028**: Scenarios accelerate (mass layoffs, mortgage defaults)
- **2030+**: SLOBODA communities thrive

### 8. What Is SLOBODA

"Not a commune. Not a sect. Not a utopia." Describes the project as decentralized infrastructure:
- Knowledge base (construction, agriculture, energy, law)
- Expert community (builders, agronomists, lawyers, engineers)
- Competency registry (find partners for your project)
- Transparent governance (every ruble visible, all decisions voted)
- Settlement network (shared experience and resources)

### 9. How It Works

Four pillars:
1. **Knowledge base** - Verified instructions and checklists
2. **Curation** - Experts verify and update materials
3. **Competency registry** - Find specialists
4. **Settlement network** - Exchange between communities

### 10. Fundraising Thermometer

Dynamic goal display (configurable via admin settings). Shows current amount, target, and percentage.

### 11. Progress / Transparency

"Where we are now" section with:
- Truth callout: "No, we haven't raised anything yet"
- Crossed-out fake progress bar (42% of 2M rubles)
- Crossed-out fake stat cards
- Link to financial reporting

### 12. Founder Story

Personal narrative from Phillip Miller:
- Not a survival guru or billionaire prepper
- Worked in tech, saw AI replacing colleagues
- Realized waiting for collapse is not a plan
- One person moving to the countryside = failure; together with experts = possible

### 13. Testimonials

Three testimonial cards from early supporters (Dmitry K., Anastasia P., Ivan S.)

### 14. FAQ for Skeptics

Five accordion items:
1. Why should I trust you? (Transparency, no cult of personality, real experts)
2. What if collapse doesn't happen? (Community + knowledge base still valuable)
3. Isn't this paranoia? (Real trends, not imagined threats)
4. How are you different from other eco-settlements? (Infrastructure for a network, not one village)
5. How much does it cost? (Free participation, voluntary donations, honest risk disclosure)

### 15. Registration Form (CTA)

Three-step multi-step form:
- **Step 1**: Basic info (email, name, telegram)
- **Step 2**: Vision (motivation, participation type, region)
- **Step 3**: Contribution (skills, financial readiness)

Progress indicator with numbered steps. Success message redirects to dashboard.

Urgency element: "Founder advantages close March 31, 2026"

### 16. Donation Section

- **Custom amount** input
- **Recurring vs one-time** toggle (recurring emphasized as preferred)
- **Comparison table**: One-time vs Monthly support advantages
- Donation modal with amount, email, recurring checkbox
- Payment via Yandex.Pay / Tinkoff Pay (planned)

### 17. Footer

Four columns: About / Navigation / Documents (concept, privacy, finance) / Contacts (email, Telegram)

### 18. Floating CTA

Appears on scroll: "The window of opportunity is closing" + "Join" button.

### 19. Exit Intent Modal

Triggered when cursor leaves viewport: offers a free guide "First steps to autonomous living" in exchange for email.
