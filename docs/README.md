## Quick Summary

**Vision**: Managed rural land ownership platform anticipating urban exodus driven by AI unemployment.

**Core Idea**: Collective infrastructure makes individual ownership possible. What's impossible alone becomes possible together.

**Three Modes**:
1. Collective shares (affordable entry)
2. Tokenized shares (liquidity)
3. Direct ownership (maximum trust)

**Key Differentiators**:
- Infrastructure-first, not land-first
- Professional management
- Geographic mobility within system
- Plan B security narrative
